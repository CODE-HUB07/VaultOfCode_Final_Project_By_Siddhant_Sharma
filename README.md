# CareerCompass AI - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

CareerCompass AI is an intelligent career recommendation system designed to provide personalized career path suggestions based on an individual's profile, education, skills, and preferences. The application uses Rapid API of GPT 4o-mini to generate tailored career recommendations with educational resources and job opportunities.

## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The application is structured according to the following principles:

1. **Single Page Application (SPA)**: The entire application runs in a single HTML page, with different "views" being rendered by React components.

2. **Component Hierarchy**:
   - `App`: The root component that handles routing
   - `Index`: Main page component
   - `CareerForm`: Multi-step form manager
   - Form Steps: Individual step components for the data collection process
   - `ResultsStep`: Component to display AI-generated career recommendations

3. **Data Flow**: The application follows a unidirectional data flow where:
   - User data is collected through form steps
   - Data is passed to parent components through props
   - Final data is sent to the AI service for processing
   - Results are displayed to the user

4. **State Management**: React's useState hook is used to manage application state. Local storage is utilized to persist user data between sessions.

### API Integration

The project integrates with Rapid API of GPT 4o-mini to generate personalized career recommendations based on the user's profile data:

1. **Data Collection**: Form collects comprehensive user profile data
2. **Data Formatting**: User data is formatted into a prompt for the AI
3. **API Request**: Formatted data is sent to Gemini AI API
4. **Response Processing**: AI responses are parsed and transformed into UI components

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies

1. **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
   - Version: 18.3.1
   - Used for creating reusable UI components and managing the view layer

2. **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript
   - Provides static type checking for improved code quality
   - Enhances developer experience with better tooling

3. **Vite**: Modern build tool and development server
   - Offers fast hot module replacement
   - Efficient bundling for production

### UI Framework and Components

1. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
   - Used for styling components using utility classes
   - Provides responsive design capabilities

2. **shadcn/ui**: High-quality React components
   - Pre-built components like buttons, cards, and form elements
   - Consistent design language throughout the application

3. **Lucide Icons**: SVG icon library
   - Provides modern, customizable icons for enhanced UI

### Routing and Navigation

**React Router DOM** (version 6.26.2):
   - Handles client-side routing
   - Enables navigation between different sections of the app

### Data Fetching and State Management

1. **TanStack React Query** (version 5.56.2):
   - Handles data fetching, caching, and state management
   - Manages loading and error states for API requests

2. **Local Storage**:
   - Persists form data between sessions
   - Improves user experience by saving progress

### External API Integration

**Google Gemini AI API**:
   - Processes user data to generate career recommendations
   - Provides detailed career information, resources, and opportunities
